Hi friend, thanks for checking out my portfolio page!
At the beginning of 2022, I completed the online course ''Freelancer lifestyle'' from Yevgen Andrikanych and managed to make several landings. I won’t stop on this because the goal is to become a full-fledged front-end developer!
I will be glad if you look at my works and the descriptions. There I tell what I learned and what difficulties I encountered.

It is my first job, which I started doing before finishing the course. The main goal was to practice BEM methodology, position,  and flex-box. The adaptive header seemed difficult since I didn’t know the elementary JavaScript yet. Therefore, it stayed without a burger menu. I did not change anything in work so that you can see the progress of my knowledge. The second difficult element turned out to be a block with social networks. I tried to place it the right way.

It is the second job. I have already completed courses where I learned about the magic preprocessor and JavaScript. Actually, in this work, I tried to apply them. I did a burger menu, also used forms and anchor links, and studied the property of transition. It turned out to be hard to make the image height adaptive. The solution was in the percentage top padding for the image block.

It is the third job. The main goal was to learn how to connect video, maps, and a slider to the page. With the help of JavaScript I made a background for a fixed header when scrolling. Did custom video start button and pause when clicking on the video area. Positioning of several blocks made a MacBook in 4th section. The hardest thing was to figure out the swiper slider.

It is the fourth job. Lots of work with JavaScript and reading documentation. It was hard to make connecting lines in the about us block so that the length of the lines was not dependent on the number of elements and the width of the screen. Numbers for the list elements are assigned independently. First time used a grid. Since I am working based on the gulp and webpack assembly from Yevgen Andrikanych, I did not have to write the logic for spoilers and star rating myself.
